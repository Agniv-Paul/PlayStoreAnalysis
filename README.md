**Abstract**

A few thousands of new applications are regularly uploaded on Google play store. A huge number of designers working freely on designing the apps and making them successful. 
With the enormous challenge from everywhere throughout the globe, it is important for a developer to know whether he/she is continuing the correct way or not. 
Since most Play Store applications are free, the income model is very obscure and inaccessible regarding how the in-application buys, 
in-application adverts and memberships add to the achievement of an application. 
In this way, an application's prosperity is normally dictated by the quantity of installation of the application and the client appraisals that it has gotten over its lifetime instead of the income is created. The objective of this experiment is to deliver insights to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize the product. 
We have tried to discover the relationships among various attributes such as which application is free or paid, what are the user reviews, rating of the application.

**Introduction:**

In today’s scenario we can see that mobile apps playing an important role in any individual’s life. 
With enormous challenge from everywhere throughout the globe, it is important for a designer to realize that he/she is continuing in the right way or not. 
To hold this income and their place in the market the application designers may need to figure out how to stick into their present position. 
The dataset with 10k Play Store applications is available to analyze the market of android. 
It can be examined to analysis the different category such as family, communication,entertainment, tools, music, camera etc. 
In this project we examine the different attributes present in the data set that affect the popularity of the application. 
We focused on to answer the questions like, what makes an app popular, what should be the price and size of the app, is there some trends in user sentiments. 
In our data set we have two csv files for data analysis: Play Store data User Reviews At first, 
we analysis the play store data and in the play store data we have 10841 rows and 13 columns & in the user review data we have 64295 rows and 5 columns of data. 
We have to take the maximum outcomes from the data which help us to analysis the which type of app is most preferable and comparisons between different insights. 
Our goal is to filter and make plots accordingly for a better EDA with respect to the final data. 
We need to explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for app engagement and success.

**Problem Statements**
1. What are the top categories on Play Store?
2. Are majority of the apps Paid or Free?
3. How importance is the rating of the application?
4. Which categories from the audience should the app be based on?
5. Which category has the most no. of installations?
6. How does the count of apps varies by Genres?
7. How does the last update has an effect on the rating?
8. How are ratings affected when the app is a paid one?
9. How are reviews and ratings co-related?
10. Lets us discuss the sentiment subjectivity.
11. Is subjectivity and polarity proportional to each other?
12. What is the percentage of review sentiments?
13. How is sentiment polarity varying for paid and free apps?
14. How Content Rating affect over the App?
15. Does Last Update date has an effects on rating?
16. Distribution of App update over the Year.
17. Distribution of Paid and Free app updated over the Month.

**Conclusion:**

Most of the apps are free so developers should focus on creating free apps to have a huge customer base. 
If developing paid apps then apps size should not be greater than 40mb. 
More Apps should be in the category like Events,Beauty,Parenting as they have not been explored much but still quite popular with huge installations. 
In order to retain the customer base apps should be updated regularly Developers should develop apps such that their content is available for everyone. 
Bulky apps should be developed in the category like Game, Family. If developing paid apps then its price should not be high and size should be less than 20mb. 
Apps belonging to Game and Family Category have high negative reviews therefore they should be developed carefully. 
Like this there can be a lot of conclusions but we have tried to cover the most important ones. 
These are some of the aspects that the developer should research before proceeding with the app development. 
By conducting a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the play store dataset, we not only eliminate avoidable risks of failure, 
but we may also be able to provide better ideas for building the app.
